"""Thin wrappers around django.core.cache.cache that degrade gracefully
if the cache backend (Redis) is unreachable, instead of raising and
breaking the request.

Every feature that touches the cache in this project - catalog caching,
the quiz submission idempotency lock - must keep working (just without
the speed-up) even when Redis is completely down. Caching and the
SETNX-style idempotency lock are both optimizations, never a correctness
requirement; the real guarantees are DB constraints (unique_together,
etc.) that exist independently of Redis.
